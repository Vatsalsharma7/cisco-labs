## üìú About the Project
This repository contains all the practical experiments that I performed using Cisco Packet Tracer to deepen my understanding of computer networking.
Each experiment helped me build practical skills in configuring routers, switches, protocols, addressing schemes, VLANs, routing algorithms, and securing devices.
Through hands-on practice, I explored real-world networking setups ranging from simple topologies to complex dynamic routing environments.

## üìö Experiments Completed
I constructed a simple network topology involving basic devices and verified successful communication, configured and verified VLANs and VLAN trunking between switches, configured static routing to manually define network paths, implemented security measures on interconnecting devices like routers and switches, designed network topologies combining routers and switches, worked with complex network topologies involving multiple routers, VLANs, trunk links, and different IP networks, retrieved MAC addresses using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), configured Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for dynamic routing, configured Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol for efficient path selection, configured Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to simulate communication between different autonomous systems, and configured important application layer protocols like DHCP for automatic IP assignment and DNS for domain name resolution.

## üéØ What I Learned
Through these experiments, I gained a solid understanding of both the theoretical concepts and practical applications of networking. I learned how to properly design and configure networks, segment traffic using VLANs, secure network devices, and implement both static and dynamic routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and BGP.
Additionally, I understood how application layer protocols like DHCP and DNS operate behind the scenes to ensure seamless network connectivity. Working with complex topologies also strengthened my troubleshooting skills and my familiarity with Cisco CLI commands.
